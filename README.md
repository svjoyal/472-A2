Before beginning execution of the project parts, please ensure that the following files are included in the submission: 'PriorityQueue.py', 'A2_RushHour.py', 'A2_functions.py', 'A2_SearchFunctions.py', 'A2_Driver.py', 'A2_Analysis.py', 'Analysis_Tests.txt', and 'sample-input.txt'

Steps to run project:

Open all .py files in your editor of choice. In case of issues, Spyder (anaconda3) was used to develop this code.
1. Run A2_Driver.py to generate all search and solution files. These files will appear in a new folder called 'A2output'.
2. Once execution of A2_Driver is complete, go to A2_SearchFunctions.py and comment out lines 58-64 inclusively so that no search files are generated for the analysis portion of the assignment. 
3. Run A2_Analysis.py*. This will generate a spreadsheet called 'Analysis.xlsx' containing details about the execution of each puzzle in the 'Analysis_Tests.txt' file.

The files generated after taking these steps should be the following: 'A2output' folder containing all 18 search and sol files for the output portion of the assignment, and an 'Analysis.xlsx' spreadsheet containing data pertaining to execution of each puzzle in 'Analysis_Tests.txt'.

<sub>* This will take some time.</sub>
